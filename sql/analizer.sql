Many factors influence what children are taught, how well they learn and the competencies they acquire, among them\nthe relevance of the syllabus, the quality of teachers’ pedagogical approaches, the assessment strategies and instructional materials\navailable. The ambition to develop a knowledge-based society and the growth of regional and global competition in the job market\nhas necessitated the shift to a competency-based syllabus. With the help of the teachers, whose role is central to the success of the\nsyllabus, learners will gain appropriate skills and be able to apply what they have learned in real life situations. Hence they will make\na difference not only to their own lives but also to the success of the nation.\nI wish to sincerely extend my appreciation to the people who contributed towards the development of this document, particularly\nREB and its staff who organized the whole process from its inception.\nSpecial appreciation goes to the development partners who supported the exercise throughout.\nAny comment or contribution would be welcome for the improvement of this syllabus.\nGasana I.

Introduction\n\nBackground to the syllabus review\nVision 2020 and other Rwanda Government’s recent policies emphasizes the ambition to become a knowledge based and technology led\neconomy and stresses the need for the generation, dissemination and acquisition of scientific skills and technological innovations, critical\nthinking, and positive values; the integration of these skills into social and economic development of Rwanda is critical. English is one of\nthe official languages and medium of instruction in schools. It plays an important role in the achievement of this vision.\n\n1.2. Rationale\nSince Rwanda is an English speaking country and a member of the East African Community and Commonwealth the teaching of English\nrequires a Competence Based Curriculum. Indeed, the curriculum of any country acts as its guiding light. The basis of this English\ncurriculum review is the need in Rwanda to shift towards a Competence Based Curriculum that focuses on developing the wholeness of\nthe learner. This wholeness would not only be achieved by giving knowledge and skills, but also through cultivating and inspiring certain\nattitudes as well as creating occasions and activities during the teaching-learning process that would enable learners to think critically\nand be able to compete favourably and fit into East Africa and the wider global community. This global outlook has underpinned the\nadoption and use of English as the language of instruction in Rwandan schools. One of the most important elements of this curriculum\nreview was to organise and provide contents and activities that would lead to a higher ‘learning achievement’.\nTherefore well thought-through learning activities and questions have been designed in the syllabus as much as possible to challenge\nstudents to think independently as well as in groups. So, it is not just about knowledge of language [the four skill areas] but how\nlearners can work in English to reason, express themselves and solve problems in a wide range of situations.\n\n1.2.1 English and society\nCommunication sits at the very base of every development trend in any country and particularly in Rwanda. Learning good English will\nnot only enable learners to pass their exams but also place them in a better position once they have finished school, to transact business\n1\n\nwith ease and exploit opportunities at local and international levels where the knowledge of English is a key pre-requisite. For this very\nreason, English will be taught as a subject from nursery through to university, whereas it will be fully used as the language of instruction\nfrom Primary four onwards. Students at O’ Level will be building on the solid language foundation they should have acquired from preprimary and primary up to this level.\nBefore engaging English as both an official language and the language of instruction in Rwanda schools, Rwandans could not effectively\nrelate with, transact and fully exploit business and other opportunities in East Africa, the Commonwealth and the rest of the English\nspeaking world. With the introduction of English in Rwanda, those problems with be solved.\n.\n\n1.2.2 English and the learners\nEnglish language is crucial for the students to achieve learning in other subjects as it is the medium of instruction at ordinary level of\neducation. As one of the official languages, English is also useful for learners to integrate in business and working situations in Rwanda.\nAlso Rwanda being part of East Africa Community and the Commonwealth, students with mastery of English Language will be able to\nexplore opportunities provided through these political and economic alliances especially and become competitive at the job market.\nFinally, English has become a global language, especially in the science and technology fields. Students with higher educational goals will\nbenefit from English learning in Rwanda to access education abroad.\n\n1.2.3 Competences\nA competency is the ability to perform a particular task successfully, resulting from having gained an appropriate combination of\nknowledge, skills and attitudes. The national policy documents, based on national aspirations, identify ‘basic Competences alongside the\n‘Generic Competencies’ that will develop higher order thinking skills. Basic competences are addressed in the stated broad subject\ncompetences and in objectives highlighted year on year basis and in each of the units of learning. The selection of types of learning\nactivities must focus on what the learners are able to demonstrate such competences throughout and at the end of the learning process.\nA generic competency is a competence that is not specific to a particular subject or situation. Generic competencies are transferrable and\napplicable to a range of subjects and situations including employment. The core competencies that must be emphasized and reflected in\nthe learning process are briefly described below and teachers will ensure that learners are exposed to tasks that help the learners\nacquire such skills.\n2\n\nCritical thinking and problem solving skills: The acquisition of such skills will help learners to think imaginatively and broadly to\nevaluate and find solutions to problems encountered in all situations.\nCreativity and innovation: The acquisition of such skills will help learners to take initiatives and use imagination beyond knowledge\nprovided to generate new ideas and construct new concepts.\nResearch: This will help learners to find answers to questions basing on existing information and concepts and to explain phenomena\nbasing on findings from information gathered.\nCommunication in official languages: Teachers, irrespective of not being teachers of language, will ensure the proper use of the language\nof instruction by learners which will help them to communicate clearly and confidently and convey ideas effectively through speaking\nand writing and using the correct language structure and relevant vocabulary.\nCooperation, inter personal management and life skills: This will help the learner to cooperate with others as a team in whatever task\nassigned and to practise positive ethical moral values and respect for the rights, feelings and views of others. Perform practical activities\nrelated to environmental conservation and protection. Advocating for personal, family and community health, hygiene and nutrition and\nresponding creatively to the variety of challenges encountered in life.\nLifelong learning: The acquisition of such skills will help learners to update knowledge and skills with minimum external support and to\ncope with evolution of knowledge advances for personal fulfilment in areas that need improvement and development.\n\n\nBroad English syllabus competences\n\nThe syllabus competences listed below describe the educational purposes of a course based on this syllabus. It outlines the\neducational context in which the syllabus content should be viewed. These competences are the same for all learners and are not\nlisted in order of priority. Some of these competencies may be delivered by the use of suitable local, international or historical\nexamples and applications, or through collaborative experimental work.\nThe pupils at Primary Level should be able to:\nCommunicate information, ideas and feelings appropriately and effectively in a range of different social settings and cultural contexts,\nListen attentively and read fluently both for information and for pleasure,\nDemonstrate an adequate command of vocabulary and language patterns in simple texts to enable them to learn and communicate in\nEnglish in different situations,\nListen to and understand English as it is spoken around them in authentic situations.\n\n\nEnglish and developing competences\n\nThese basic competences alongside the generic competences are stated in such a way that will develop higher order thinking skills\nand this will help the subject learning and application of what has been learnt in real life situation. Through experimentation,\n3\n\nobservations and presentation of information during the learning process, the learner develops not only deductive and inductive\nskills but also communication, critical thinking and problem solving skills in trying to make inferences and conclusions.\n\n\n\n2. Pedagogical approach\n\nSince each learner is an individual with his/her own needs, pace of learning, experiences and abilities, teaching strategies must be\nvaried but flexible within well-structured sequences of lessons. However, learner-centered education does not mean that the teacher\nno longer has responsibility for seeing that learning takes place. Teachers will find useful suggestions to implement the child centered\nand interactive learning approach in the activities and methodology columns of this curriculum.\nLanguage learning is a process. But by this time, a student is expected to have achieved English language basics. When they make\nerrors, the teacher should support them accordingly but also accept their attempts to use the language correctly.\nAt this stage, students are also encouraged and expected to further develop the culture of reading for both information and\nenjoyment.\nSchools should provide a conducive environment for students to practise their English by participating in different clubs such as\ndebating, drama and music because students learn well when they are actively involved in the learning process through a high degree\nof participation, contribution and production.\nWith stronger language abilities at this level and with continued teacher to student support, learners will read more fluently and\nwrite accurately. Teachers must bear in mind that students learn in different ways and at different rates.\nTeachers need to provide a variety of learning experiences to support all learners. The classroom should be a safe and friendly place\nin which to learn and experiment with the language by:\nEnsuring constant access by students to the library and encouraging them to read and write within and beyond the framework of the\ncurriculum with comprehension,\nWriting accurately for both functional and creative writing purposes,\nIntegrating into other English speaking communities with sufficient command of English language characterised by adequate\ncompetences, knowledge and attitudes\n\n4\n\n2.1 Role of the teacher\nThe change to a competence-based curriculum is about transforming learning, ensuring that it is deep, enjoyable and habit-forming.\nThe teacher ought to shift from the traditional method of instruction to adopt a facilitator role, to allow learners’ active involvement\nin the teaching-learning process.\nThe teacher must identify the needs of the learners, the nature of the learning to be carried out, the means to shape learning\nexperiences through challenging level appropriate situations in order to enhance critical thinking and problem solving skills. The role\nof the teacher is to organize learners in and outside the classroom and engage them while using participatory and interactive\nmethods throughout the learning process. Tasks can be given to individuals, pairs and groups. This ensures that learning is\npersonalized, participative and co-operative. The teacher will design and introduce tasks to the class to perform [as in role play] or\nfor immediate discussion. The role of the teacher will be to guide the learners in constructing their own knowledge and to translate\nthat knowledge into set competences.\nLearners should be taught how to use the textbooks and other resource materials in different ways: to search for and make use of\ninformation in expressive, denotative and connotative contexts.\n\n2.2 Role of the learner\nThe activities of the learner are indicated in each learning unit and reflect appropriate engagement in the learning process.\nThe teaching and learning processes will be tailored towards creating a learner friendly environment based on learners’ capabilities,\nneeds, experience and interests.\nThe learning activities will be organized in a way that encourages learners to construct their knowledge, either individually or in\ngroups, in an active and engaging way.\nLearners work on key competences in the form of concrete units with specific learning outcomes broken down into knowledge, skills\nand attitude.\nIn practical lessons learners will work in groups where the availability of the apparatus will not permit working individually but they\nwill be encouraged to do simple project work individually.\n\n2.3 Special needs education and inclusive approach\nAll Rwandans have the right to access education regardless of their different needs. The underpinnings of this provision would\nnaturally hold that all citizens benefit from the same menu of educational programs. The possibility of this assumption is the focus of\n5\n\nspecial needs education. The critical issue is that we have persons/ learners who are totally different in their ways of living and\nlearning as opposed to the majority. The difference can either be emotional, physical, sensory and intellectual learning challenged\ntraditionally known as mental retardation.\nThese learners equally have the right to benefit from the free and compulsory basic education in the nearby ordinary/mainstream\nschools. Therefore, the schools’ role is to enrol them and also set strategies to provide relevant education to them. The teacher\ntherefore is requested to consider each learner’s needs during teaching and learning process. Assessment strategies and conditions\nshould also be standardised to the needs of these learners. Detailed guidance for each category of learners with special education\nneeds is provided for in the guidance for teachers.\n\n6\n\n\n\n3. Assessment approaches\n\nAssessment is the process of evaluating the teaching and learning processes through collecting and interpreting evidence of\nindividual learner’s progress in learning and to make a judgment about a learner’s achievements measured against defined standards.\nAssessment is an integral part of the teaching learning processes. In the new competence-based curriculum assessment must also be\ncompetence-based; whereby a learner is given a complex situation related to his/her everyday life and asked to try to overcome the\nsituation by applying what he/she learned.\nAssessment will be organized at the following levels: School-based assessment, District examinations, National assessment (LARS)\nand National examinations.\n\nTypes of assessment\nFormative and continuous assessment (assessment for learning)\nContinuous assessment involves formal and informal methods used by schools to check whether learning is taking place. When a\nteacher is planning his/her lesson, he/she should establish criteria for performance and behavior changes at the beginning of a unit.\nThen at the of end of every unit, the teacher should ensure that all the learners have mastered the stated key unit competencies\nbasing on the criteria stated, before going to the next unit. The teacher will assess how well each learner masters both the subject and\nthe generic competencies described in the syllabus and from this, the teacher will gain a picture of the all-round progress of the\nlearner. The teacher will use one or a combination of the following: (a) observation (b) pen and paper (c) oral questioning.\n\n3.1.2 Summative assessment (assessment of learning)\nWhen assessment is used to record a judgment of a competence or performance of the learner, it serves a summative purpose.\nSummative assessment gives a picture of a learner’s competence or progress at any specific moment. The main purpose of summative\nassessment is to evaluate whether learning objectives have been achieved and to use the results for the ranking or grading of\nlearners, for deciding on progression, for selection into the next level of education and for certification. This assessment should have\nan integrative aspect whereby a student must be able to show mastery of all competencies.\nIt can be internal school based assessment or external assessment in the form of national examinations. School based summative\nassessment should take place once at the end of each term and once at the end of the year. School summative assessment average\n7\n\nscores for each subject will be weighted and included in the final national examinations grade. School based assessment average\ngrade will contribute a certain percentage as teachers gain more experience and confidence in assessment techniques and in the third\nyear of the implementation of the new curriculum it will contribute 10% of the final grade, but will be progressively increased.\nDistricts will be supported to continue their initiative to organize a common test per class for all the schools to evaluate the\nperformance and the achievement level of learners in individual schools. External summative assessment will be done at the end of\nP6, S3 and S6.\n\n3.2 Record keeping\nThis is gathering facts and evidence from assessment instruments and using them to judge the student’s performance by assigning an\nindicator against the set criteria or standard. Whatever assessment procedures used shall generate data in the form of scores which\nwill be carefully be recorded and stored in a portfolio because they will contribute for remedial actions, for alternative instructional\nstrategy and feed back to the learner and to the parents to check the learning progress and to advice accordingly or to the final\nassessment of the students.\nThis portfolio is a folder (or binder or even a digital collection) containing the student’s work as well as the student’s evaluation of\nthe strengths and weaknesses of the work. Portfolios reflect not only work produced (such as papers and assignments), but also it is\na record of the activities undertaken over time as part of student learning. Besides, it will serve as a verification tool for each learner\nthat he/she attended the whole learning before he/she undergoes the summative assessment for the subject.\n\nItem writing in summative assessment\nBefore developing a question paper, a plan or specification of what is to be tested or examined must be elaborated to show the units\nor topics to be tested on, the number of questions in each level of Bloom’s taxonomy and the marks allocation for each question. In a\ncompetency based curriculum, questions from higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy should be given more weight than those from\nknowledge and comprehension level.\nBefore developing a question paper, the item writer must ensure that the test or examination questions are tailored towards\ncompetency based assessment by doing the following:\n Identify topic areas to be tested on from the subject syllabus.\n Outline subject-matter content to be considered as the basis for the test.\n Identify learning outcomes to be measured by the test.\n Prepare a table of specifications.\n8\n\n\n\nEnsure that the verbs used in the formulation of questions do not require memorization or recall answers only but testing broad\ncompetencies as stated in the syllabus.\n\nStructure and format of the examination for English Language:\nAt primary level there will be one paper including four sections:\nSection A: Composition writing;\nSection B: Grammar;\nSection C: Vocabulary\n\nReporting to parents\nThe wider range of learning in the new curriculum means that it is necessary to think again about how to share learners’ progress\nwith parents. A single mark is not sufficient to convey the different expectations of learning which are in the learning objectives. The\nmost helpful reporting is to share what students are doing well and where they need to improve.\n\n\n\n4.1 Material resources\n\nTeaching and learning of English language is presented in context in order for the learners to practice the language. The successful\nimplementation of this curriculum requires appropriate teaching aids including text books, teachers’ guides, audio visuals, maps, real\nmaterials for primary school learners, It is hoped that ICT also will help in this language learning process.\n\n4.2 Skills required for the teacher of this subject\nEngage students in variety of learning activities;\nUse multiple teaching and assessment methods;\nAdjust instructions to the level of the learner;\nCreativity and innovation;\nMakes connections/links with other subjects;\n9\n\nShould have a high level of knowledge of the content;\nEffective discipline skills;\nGood classroom management skills\nGood communicator;\nGuide and counsellor;\nPassion for children teaching and learning;\n\n10\n\n\n\nPrimary English Syllabus Units\n\nP1 English Syllabus Units\nTopic Area: Oral and Written Communication\nP1 English\nUnit 1: Welcome to the Classroom\nKey Unit competence: To use language learnt in the context of the classroom\nLearning objectives\nContent\nKnowledge and\nSkills\nAttitudes and\nunderstanding\nvalues\nIdentify\nRecognise familiar\nListen carefully.\nLanguage use\npersonal and\nnames and words.\npossessive\nPay attention to\nGreeting people\npronouns.\nGreet people in a\nthe teacher.\nGood morning, Good afternoon,\nschool and home\nGood evening, Hello!

Spoken English has more than 26 sounds though. There\nare roughly 44 different sounds. Therefore it\'s not very easy only to use the letters of the alphabet to show the\npronunciation of English.\nThere is a system which uses a group of symbols. Some of these symbols look the same as letters and some are very\ndifferent.\nYou can use these symbols to write out the pronunciation of words and in many dictionaries for English learners you\nwill see the pronunciation written out.\nTo show that what is written are sounds and not letters the transcriptions are written between slashes, / /. For\nexample, the pronunciation of the word \'pet\' is written: /pet/.\nIn this example the sound symbols look exactly the same as the letters. You can only tell we are talking about\npronunciation rather than spelling because of the / /. However, some words look very different when you see their\npronunciation.\n\nis the word \'church\'.\n\nSounds and letters\nVowel sounds are not the same as vowel letters. The word European begins with the vowel letter \'E\' but the first sound\nis actually a consonant sound /j/. So, when speaking the word European will be preceded by the article \'a\' and not \'an\'.\nSounds and spelling\n\n153\n\nIt\'s important to note that the spelling of a word is not always an accurate guide to how it is pronounced. Similarly\nthe pronunciation of a word is not always helpful when working out how that word should be spelt.\nThere are 26 letters in the English alphabet but there are many more sounds in the English language. This means\nthat the number of sounds in a word is not always the same as the number of letters.\nFor example, the word \'CAT\' has three letters and three sounds but the word \'CATCH\' has five letters but still only\nthree sounds.\nIf we write these words using sound symbols, we can see exactly how many sounds they have.\nCAT is written\nCATCH is written\nIn \'CATCH\' the three letters TCH are one sound represented by one symbol\nStress and syllable\nStress could be roughly described as the relative strength of a syllable. We can study stress from the point of view of\nproduction and of perception. The production of stress is generally believed to depend on the speaker using more\nmuscular energy than is used for unstressed syllables.\nA syllable is a very important unit. We can divide a word into one or more syllables. For example mum has one\nsyllable, mother has two syllables and grandmother has three syllables. A syllable is a group of one or more sounds.\nThe essential part of a syllable is a vowel sound (V). Some syllables are just one vowel sound. Fr example, these\nwords have one syllable, and the syllable is just one vowel sound: eye or I /aɪ /, owe /əʊ/, ear / ɪə/. A syllable can\n\n154\n\nhave consonant sounds (C) before the V: go, my, know, weigh, after the V: if, egg, ice, eight or before and after the\nV: ten, nose, mouth, knife\n\n155\n\n\n\n7.
